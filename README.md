# convert markdown table to json code-fenced markdown table

uses a [gitlab feature](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#json) to
make snazzy tables!

github pages site: https://aae42.github.io/markdown-table-to-json/

the irony of having this on github when it's for gitlab is not lost on me,
i just don't use github enough and it's good to have a few projects on here
